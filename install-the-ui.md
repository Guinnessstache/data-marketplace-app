# DATA MARKETPLACE APPLICATION

Food Data Market is an inclusive marketplace fostering new economic models for sustainable food supply chains based on data. It leverages key benefits of distributed ledger technologies (trust, neutrality, and inclusiveness) while keeping the key advantages of participants intact by employing a privacy-by-design approach that enables farmers and cooperatives to regain control of their data, give it a price tag, and sell it to interested partners in the supply chain.
